# alphafold_MSA

This implementation of the Alphafold 2 algorithm was made for my Bachelor thesis and it is made to be able to run the Alphafold 2 monomer model direcly with MSAs as input and to get the predicted distances between pairs (disotgram) as an output.

### Installation guide

This installation guide was extracted from https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker, and modified to adapt it to out purpose.
